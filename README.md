# Visit London - Travel Site

**Link**: https://visit-london.netlify.app/ <br>
Quick Note: I'm using Render to host the backend, but the free version of Render is a bit wonky (every time you load the site, it takes a while to reconnect to the backend). If any of the accommodations or attractions don't show up, you might have to open the link a few times.

### Software and Platforms Used:
**Platform:**
  - _Front-end_: React.js
  - _Back-end_: Node.js<br>
  
**Design Tools:** Figma<br>
**Other Integrations:** Google Maps API (through Google Cloud)

### Outline/Sitemap

**Home Page**: Landing page that introduces London with a brief overview/history.<br>
**Attractions Page**: List of the top attractions, featuring descriptions, images, and an embed to Google Maps for easy navigation. Includes option to sort between free and paid attractions to account for all budgets.<br>
**Accommodations Page**: Curated selection of accommodations with options for different budget levels, each including a description, pricing, link to book, and Google Maps embed.

### Development and Design Process
**Initial Design and Layout**: Design began with wireframes, where the main structure of each page was laid out. Basic mockups of each page were developed in Figma.<br>

**Functional Elements**: Considering users would most likely be using this site to research attractions and accomodations for their visit to London, I incorporated Google Maps APIs to improve the user experience.
